# Work Day Schedule

I built this Work Day Scheduler to assist anyone who needs a simple application to plan out their work schedule. The application easily displays what hour it currently is and what you have ahead of you in your day. This was my first time using jQuery in a full application so I learned a lot about how jQuery and the DOM. 

When entering new information into each input area, you can save the line you're currently on by clicking the "Enter" key or clicking the save icon on the right. If you would prefer, you can fill everything out and click the 'Save All' button at the bottom of the page.
